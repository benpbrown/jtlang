# Code Samples for the JT Programming Language #

This repository contains code samples for the [JT programming language](http://research.cs.queensu.ca/~cordy/cisc458/458_Project_Desc_2016.pdf).

This programming language has been developed by modifying the PT Pascal compiler written by J. Alan Rosselet.
